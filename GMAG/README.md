The notebooks in this tutorial will go over the basics of GMAG, loading data, accessing data & metadata, identifying stations in key locations, and plotting & basic analysis of data. 

The notebooks can be ran in either:

1. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/): this method is the simplest and requires no Python distribution, installation of any code, or downloading of data to your computer. **This is ideal if you only want to follow along with the tutorial.**
1. Locally on your computer: this method requires you to download and install the GMAG package and set your download directory. It also requires a Python distribution (I suggest Anaconda). **This is ideal if you intend on using ground-based magnetometer data.**

**If you choose to run GMAG locally follow the [Installation Instruction](#gmag-installation) below.**

- Colab
- Local

## GMAG Installation

- Download (and unzip) the GMAG github repository to your Python/Coding directory
- Open a terminal and navigate to the GMAG directory
    - If you've install Anacond open and ```cd``` to the GMAG directory
