# 2024 DASP Student Workshop on aurora-asi-lib (asilib)

Two useful links:
- [Docs](https://aurora-asi-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) --- if you're struggling with exercises, take look at the examples and API reference
- [GitHub](http://github.com/mshumko/aurora-asi-lib)

To avoid downloading ~5 GB of ASI data during the tutorial, we made have it downloaded it to a [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E-ZEC_E_m-77DeF2DZPZuNSLzp0BqZCE?usp=drive_link) folder. Add it to your Google Drive before you run the Colab notebook.

1. Add it to your personal Google Drive
2. Create a shortcut of this folder in your main google Drive folder.
