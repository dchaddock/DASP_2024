To avoid downloading ~5 GB of ASI data during the tutorial, we made have it downloaded it to a [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gq-wYKa2FeW82puXq0LHIck8b2zeQd7W?usp=sharing) folder. Add it to your Google Drive before you run the Colab notebook.

1. Add it to your personal Google Drive
2. Create a shortcut of this folder in your main google Drive folder.
